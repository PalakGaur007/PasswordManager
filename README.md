# PasswordManager
The provided Java code is an implementation of a simple password manager application. It allows users to manage and store password records securely. Here's a summary of its key functionalities:
1. User Interaction:
   - It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the password manager.
2. Password Storage:
   - Password records are stored in an ArrayList called `passwordRecords`.
   - Passwords are encrypted using the MD5 hashing algorithm for security.
3. Main Password:
   - The application uses a main password to encrypt and decrypt other passwords.
   - Users can set or change the main password.
4. Commands and Actions:
   - Users can execute various commands, such as adding new passwords, deleting passwords, displaying stored passwords, and getting help.
5. File Handling:
   - Password records and the main password are stored in a data file (`data.dat`).
   - The application reads from and updates this file to persist data between sessions.
6. Input Validation:
   - The application enforces password criteria, such as minimum length and character types.
   - It checks for the uniqueness of keywords associated with passwords.
7. User Guidance:
   - A help menu provides users with information about available commands and their usage.
8. Data Encryption:
   - Passwords are securely stored in the data file with XOR encryption.
9. Application Flow:
   - The main method orchestrates the application flow, including login, data loading, and command execution.
Overall, this password manager provides a basic but functional way for users to store and manage their passwords while keeping them secure through encryption.
